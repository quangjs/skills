1. JavaScript Core Fundamentals
Mastering these is non-negotiable for any level of developer.
Scope & The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
 * Concepts: Global, Function, and Block scope.
 * Key Difference: var is function-scoped and hoisted with undefined. let and const are block-scoped and hoisted into the TDZ—accessing them before declaration throws a ReferenceError.
The Prototype Chain
 * Definition: Every JS object has a private property pointing to another object called its prototype.
 * Inheritance: When accessing a property, JS looks at the object, then its prototype, then the prototype's prototype, until it reaches null.
 * Modern Note: Use Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) instead of __proto__.
Closures
 * Definition: A function bundled together with references to its surrounding state (lexical environment).
 * Use Case: Data encapsulation (private variables) and functional programming patterns like "Currying."
 * Example:
   function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return () => ++count; // Remembers 'count' even after createCounter finishes
}

The Event Loop
 * Mechanism: JS is single-threaded but handles concurrency via the Event Loop.
 * Priority: 1.  Call Stack: Synchronous code.
   2.  Microtask Queue: Promises, queueMicrotask, MutationObserver (High priority).
   3.  Task Queue (Macrotasks): setTimeout, setInterval, I/O (Lower priority).
2. Asynchronous Mastery
Interviewers focus on how you handle data fetching and race conditions.
Promise Methods
 * Promise.all(): Fails if any promise rejects.
 * Promise.allSettled(): Waits for all to finish, regardless of success/failure.
 * Promise.race(): Settles as soon as the first promise settles.
 * Promise.any(): Settles as soon as the first successful promise settles.
Error Handling
 * Always use try/catch with async/await.
 * Understand the "Unhandled Rejection" event.
3. TypeScript: Advanced Type System
Shift from "Basic Types" to "Type Logic."
Interfaces vs. Types
| Feature | Interface | Type Alias |
|---|---|---|
| Extension | extends | Intersection (&) |
| Merging | Automatic declaration merging | Impossible |
| Usage | Best for Object structures | Best for Unions, Primitives, Tuples |
Generics
Generics allow you to create reusable components that work with a variety of types while maintaining type safety.
function wrapInArray<T>(value: T): T[] {
  return [value];
}

Key Utility Types
 * Partial<T>: All properties optional.
 * Required<T>: All properties required.
 * Readonly<T>: Cannot reassign properties.
 * Record<K, T>: Map keys of type K to values of type T.
 * Pick<T, K> / Omit<T, K>: Extract or remove specific keys.
Type Narrowing & Guards
 * typeof: For primitives.
 * instanceof: For class instances.
 * Type Predicates: function isString(val: any): val is string { ... }
4. 2026 Modern Features & Best Practices
Demonstrate that your knowledge is current.
 * structuredClone(): The native way to deep-clone objects without losing Dates or RegEx.
 * Decorators: Now a standard feature in TS for logging, validation, and Dependency Injection.
 * Satisfies Operator: The satisfies keyword allows you to validate an object matches a type without losing the specific inferred type of the properties.
 * Explicit Resource Management: The using keyword for automatic cleanup (Disposables).
5. Coding Challenge Topics
Be prepared to implement these on a whiteboard:
 * Debounce & Throttle: For performance optimization on scroll/resize events.
 * Deep Merge/Clone: Handling nested objects.
 * Flatten Array: Converting [1, [2, [3]]] to [1, 2, 3].
 * Promisify: Converting a callback-based function to a Promise-based one.
Next Step:
Would you like me to provide a code snippet for one of the complex patterns above, like a custom Debounce function or a Generic API wrapper?
